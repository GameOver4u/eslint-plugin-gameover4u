# eslint-plugin-gameover4u

**eslint-plugin-gameover4u** is a personal ESLint plugin that enforces rules and code styles according to my own preferences, mainly focused on React/TypeScript projects.

This plugin is a work-in-progress. Some rules are planned, and anyone is welcome to suggest rules or improvements — I will consider requests and add them if possible.

## Usage

Install via npm (once published) or use locally:

```bash
npm install eslint-plugin-gameover4u --save-dev
```

In your ESLint config:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["gameover4u"],
  "rules": {
    "gameover4u/<rule-name>": "warn"
  }
}
```

## Contributing

* Feel free to open issues for new rules, improvements, or questions.
* Pull requests are welcome — just make sure to follow TypeScript conventions.

## License

See LICENSE for details. Must credit **GameOver4u** if code is used.
